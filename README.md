This project implements a **text-based calculator** that evaluates a series of assignment expressions using a subset of Java-like syntax. 
It is designed to demonstrate core competencies in:

- Software engineering
- Optimization
- Concurrency handling
- Architectural design

The calculator supports variable assignments, pre/post increment operations, and arithmetic expressions. 
It processes input line-by-line and outputs the final values of all variables.
